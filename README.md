# Boilerplate for React-Webpack-Express && Sass!



### Free to a good home


#### To Run:

You will need to run two terminals with this boilerplate; one for webpack and another to compile Sass.

` npm install `

in one terminal (node server && webpack):

` npm run dev `

in another terminal (compiles sass on save):

`npm run scss`



**Enjoy!**
